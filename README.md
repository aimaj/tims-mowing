Tim’s Mowing is a B2B mowing company, they mow lawns for all sorts of business and companies. Many companies have nature strips or small lawn areas that need care, but they don’t have enough to warrant dedicated gardeners.

They have a few relationships with existing companies, and new customers call through all the time to make bookings. They are a small business just getting started, and take cash payments and written invoices each time a mower completes a booking. In the future they might move to digital payments.
They have decided to use Salesforce to manage their customers and bookings, and are very agile for their industry, with features and processes constantly iterating.
Luckily for them, the owner’s niece is a software developer. She has helped set up a production org and a test sandbox, with a small codebase in GitHub with a few features, automatically deploying to the test sandbox. They have a few features they want built, and are grateful for the agile teams volunteered to help them get going, as a new customer.
